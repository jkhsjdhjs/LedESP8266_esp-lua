# lua.led
Simple LED controlling software written in Lua for ESP8266 microcontrollers running NodeMCU with a PCA9685 as PWM-Driver.

### TODO:
- restructure code
- find out how to smoothly control the brightness of each color with the PCA9685
- add fade functions to fade from one color to another
- add a basic server to accept json encoded data
- improve readme (add more infos, requirements etc)
